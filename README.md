##Modeling_Test

#Problem
Given some transactions, we want to understand the purchase behavior against different products to generate personalized offers.

The data (txn_train.csv) is a sample of transactions. We are trying to predict the dependent variable (purchase) with the help of the information contained in the other variables.

Your model performance will be evaluated on the basis of your prediction of the purchase amount, you can use any data error metric, the root mean squared error (RMSE) is suggested.

#Evaluation
For the evaluation send your problem statement and final conclusions in any of the following formats: Notebook, Pdf, Ppt. Also attached the code with the modeling process.

#Rules
You are free to use any tool/machine you have access. You can use any programming language. Python is prefered.
